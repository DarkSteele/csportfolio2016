        <td>The mouse is an input device that moves an on-screen cursor to different items and texts. It is used to select, move, highlight, and manipulate the items on the screen. The keyboard is a typewriter-like device that uses an arrangement of number, letter, and symbol keys to input text and other items onto the computer. Using the keyboard, I was able to make this website! The computer monitor is the display screen used to show visual output from a computer, camera, and other video generating devices.</td>
