        <p> Hello!</p>

<p> I have traveled to a handful of interesting places, scattered across North America.I live in sunny California, and have visited places all the way from Colorado to Florida. I really enjoy visiting Canada, my place of origin. It is very beautiful there, and I love spending time with my family. </p>
<p> I am 14 years old, and I am already 6 feet tall. Crazy, right? I have been playing basketball since for over 8 years, and have a great passion for it. I play cello and guitar, and have an amazing ear and passion for music. I always look forwards to the better of things, even if they are not the most fun. I try my best to look out for those around me, and help in any way that I can. I don't bite!</p>
  
  <p> 
  
  <p>One of my largest passions and hobbies is art. Cartoons/doodling, painting, sketching, anything. Art is a way I can freely express myself, my emotions, feelings, and thoughts. Scribbling out silly little doodles helps me relieve stress, and it is a great amount of fun.  </p>
